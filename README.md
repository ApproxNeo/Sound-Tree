# Sound-Tree
Soundboard made in python with unique organization structure

Video example: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_3aXlMwmqxA

Run the script using 'python sound_tree.py' from the command line.

Download a virtual cable (https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/) and it will pipe the audio to the virtual cable. Then make the virtual cable the input in some other program or game you're using, and you can use the soundboard as the input to that application!

Download more .wav sound files and add them to the structure as shown in the folders in this repository. Then use the numpad on your keyboard to press the key combinations that correspond to your sound file!

Let me know if you use this and enjoy it, I had a lot of fun making it!
